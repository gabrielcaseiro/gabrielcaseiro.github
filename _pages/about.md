I am a PhD student in Politics at NYU and hold an MSc in Economics from the [São Paulo School of Economics](https://economics-sp.fgv.br). I am interested in topics in comparative politics and political economy, particularly those related to electoral behavior and electoral geography, with a regional focus on Brazil.

I hold an MSc in Economics from the [São Paulo School of Economics](https://economics-sp.fgv.br) and am a predoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins SAIS under the United Programs for Political Economy Research (UPPER) Network’s Global Research Training Initiative for Latin America. 

I am deeply interested in topics related to political economy and electoral behavior. My research primarily centers around the application of causal inference methods and rational choice political reasoning. I focus my studies on the dynamic political landscape of Brazil, a nation celebrated for being one of the world's largest democracies. Currently, my research efforts are concentrated on unraveling the intricate relationship between electoral coalitions and candidates' spatial voting patterns in Brazilian local elections. This investigation contributes to the core of my academic pursuits, as I strive to gain deeper insights into the functioning of local elections and their impact on the broader political landscape.

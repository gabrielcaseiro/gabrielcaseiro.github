*Abstract:* Why do parties form electoral coalitions? This research tries to shed new light on the understanding of electoral coalitions in local elections through a novel approach that considers the impacts of these alliances on candidates' spatial patterns of vote distributions. These spatial patterns provide information on the clustering of candidates' support and their dominance over local constituencies. I outline two hypotheses linking mayoral electoral coalitions to the interaction between mayoral and city council candidates' spatial voting performances that are empirically tested in the context of the Brazilian 2020 Municipal Elections. I find that mayoral and council candidates' spatial patterns of vote distribution become more positively dependent when their parties are allied in a mayoral electoral coalition and that what is behind this dependence increase are council candidates acting as local brokers for the mayoral candidate in their mayoral electoral coalition. These results are robust to a series of alternative specifications and robustness checks. To my knowledge, this research represents the first effort in studying spatial patterns of vote distribution in the context of local elections at the polling station level.
